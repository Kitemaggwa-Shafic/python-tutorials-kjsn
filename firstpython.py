# create in 1990s by Guido Van Russom
# started in Xmass season, with urge of creating a lnsguage as powerfull as C but easyto write
# he wanted to simplify C, and easy as B created  a laguange AB which is part of C and B and this language has no name
# he was watching a commedy clip, he was watching its montey Py and then named his language AB "PYTHON"
# A python file is called a script
# Python is dynamically typed ie you don't need to specify variables

# Python Syntax & Semantics 
# Syntax the rules that govern the use of a language eg in eng I did went (gramatically wrong) an empthatic verb with past tense
# Semantics the meaning of the rules of a language, most times the semantics can be right but the meaning wrong or VV
# 
# First semantic of python
# Telling a computer to reserve memory space



cohort13 = 100
# Explaining the above line of statement below;
# This is a statement, a complete instruction, a group of statements makes up a code or two or more statements,
# cohort-13 is a name given to a computer memory space and store 100, or cohort-13 is a variable ( is a named memory space in a PC)
# the process of creating a name for a memory space is called Declaring
# the process of putting a value is called Initializing
# So with our "cohort-13=100" is called our Logic 
print("Hello World, this is Python class cohort 13") # This is what python will display out
