# Assign any variable a number
# Assignment Operator
a = 10 # (assign "a" to 10)
# so in this example 'a' is assigned to a new value from above print value os 'a'

# Addition Assignment 
a += 5    #( adding 5 to value of "a" above)
print ("a += 5 : ", a) # (a = 15)

# Subtraction Assignment
a -= 5   #( subtracting 5 to value of "a" above)
print ("a -= 5 : ", a) #(a = 10)

# Multiplication Assignment
a *= 5   #(multiplying 5 to value of "a" above)
print ("a *= 5 : ", a)  #(a = 50)

# Division Assignment
a /= 5  #(dividing 5 to value of "a" above)
print ("a /= 5 : ",a)    #(a = 10.0)

# modulus Assignment
a %= 3   #(modulus 3 to value of "a" above)
print ("a %= 3 : ", a)     #(a = 1.0)

# Exponent Assignment
a **= 2     #(exponent 2 to value of "a" above)
print ("a **= 2 : ", a)     #(a = 1.0)

# Floor Division Assignment
a //= 3     #(floor division of 3 to value of "a" above)
print ("a //= 3 : ", a)     #(a = 0.0)
